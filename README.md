# Smart Battery Monitoring System with Explainable AI

A research-driven intelligent battery analytics platform for battery health prediction, Remaining Useful Life (RUL) estimation, explainable AI, and retrieval-augmented battery guidance.

## Live Deployment

- Frontend Dashboard: https://smart-battery-frontend.onrender.com/
- Backend API: https://smart-battery-api.onrender.com/

## Overview

This project combines machine learning, SHAP explanations, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and an interactive React dashboard for battery monitoring and decision support.

The platform supports:

## Dataset

The implementation uses the NASA Prognostics Center of Excellence battery dataset for battery degradation modeling and predictive analysis.

Dataset source:

https://ti.arc.nasa.gov/tech/dash/groups/pcoe/prognostic-data-repository/

Supported battery samples include:

- B0005
- B0006

```

## Installation

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd smart-battery-monitoring
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Download NASA battery dataset files and place them inside:

```text
data/raw/
```

## Running Locally

Start the backend API:

```bash
python backend/api.py
```

Start the frontend:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

For local React development, either rely on the `proxy` in `frontend/package.json` or create `frontend/.env` from `frontend/.env.example`.

## API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Description |
|---|---|
| `/health` | API health status, including model and RAG load state |
| `/predict` | Battery prediction endpoint |
| `/batch_predict` | Batch battery prediction endpoint |
| `/model_info` | Model metadata |
| `/rag/query` | Retrieval-augmented battery query endpoint |

### RAG Query Contract

Request:

```json
{
  "query": "Why does my battery heat while charging?",
  "top_k": 3,
  "provider": "auto"
}
```

Response includes:

- `provider`: answer provider used
- `knowledge_base.document_count`: total docs in the RAG knowledge base
- `knowledge_base.embedding_model`: embedding model used
- `retrieved_documents`: source documents shown in the frontend

## Render Deployment

This repo is configured for two separate Render services:

- `smart-battery-api`: Python web service for Flask, predictions, SHAP, and RAG.
- `smart-battery-frontend`: React static site for the dashboard.

Deploy both from `render.yaml` using Render Blueprints.

### Backend Environment Variables

```text
FRONTEND_ORIGIN=https://your-frontend-site.onrender.com
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-key
GEMINI_MODEL=gemini-1.5-flash
```

`GEMINI_API_KEY` belongs only on the backend service. Do not add it to the frontend static site.

### Frontend Environment Variables

```text
REACT_APP_API_URL=https://your-api-service.onrender.com
```

With the current Blueprint, Render can derive `REACT_APP_API_URL` from the API service and `FRONTEND_ORIGIN` from the frontend service. Render still prompts for secret keys such as `GEMINI_API_KEY` because they are marked with `sync: false`.
